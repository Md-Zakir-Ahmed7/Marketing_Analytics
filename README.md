Project Objective :The objective of this project is to optimize inventory and sales management for a retail and wholesale business by identifying actionable insights that improve profitability. This involves analyzing brand performance, vendor contributions, bulk purchasing strategies, inventory efficiency, and profitability variances to support data-driven decision-making.

Key Points / Goals:

Identify Underperforming Brands: ‚Ä¢ Detect brands with low sales or profitability. ‚Ä¢ Recommend promotional or pricing strategies to boost sales without compromising margins.

Evaluate Vendor Performance: ‚Ä¢ Determine top vendors contributing to overall sales and gross profit. ‚Ä¢ Identify underperforming vendors and assess the need for improved partnerships or strategies.

Analyse Bulk Purchasing Impact: ‚Ä¢ Examine how bulk purchases affect unit costs and overall profitability. ‚Ä¢ Suggest optimal purchasing strategies to maximize cost efficiency.

Assess Inventory Turnover: ‚Ä¢ Measure inventory movement and holding costs. ‚Ä¢ Recommend actions to reduce slow-moving stock and improve inventory efficiency.

Investigate Profitability Variance: ‚Ä¢ Compare high-performing vs low-performing vendors in terms of profit margins. ‚Ä¢ Identify key factors driving profitability differences and suggest corrective actions.
